# Performance Testing Rules

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to **performance testing only**. It does NOT handle functional testing, business logic validation, or API contract testing.

## Test Focus Areas
- **Load Testing**: Normal expected load (10-50 users)
- **Stress Testing**: Beyond normal capacity (25-50+ users)
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden load bursts (5→50→5 users)

## What NOT to Test
- Business logic correctness (handled by regression pack)
- API contract validation (handled by regression pack)
- Edge case handling (handled by regression pack)
- Basic connectivity (handled by regression pack)

## Test Organization
- `scenarios/load/` - Normal expected load tests
- `scenarios/stress/` - Beyond normal capacity tests
- `scenarios/spike/` - Sudden load burst tests

## Key Principles
1. Focus on performance metrics: response times, throughput, resource utilization
2. Test under various load conditions, not business scenarios
3. Use realistic but performance-focused test data
4. Measure and report performance characteristics
5. Avoid duplicating functional test coverage
