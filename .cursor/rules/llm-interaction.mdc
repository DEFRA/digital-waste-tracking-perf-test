# LLM Interaction Rules

## Repository Understanding
- This is a JMeter-based performance testing repository for CDP Platform
- Focus is on load, stress, and spike testing only
- Functional testing is handled by a separate regression pack
- Tests use external JSON payload files for reusability

## Key Files to Understand
- `scenarios/` - Contains organized JMX test files by operation and test type
- `payloads/` - Contains shared JSON payload files
- `TEST_ORGANIZATION.md` - Test structure and usage guide
- `PAYLOAD_STRUCTURE.md` - Payload file documentation
- `entrypoint.sh` - Docker container entry point
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration

## Test Organization
- `scenarios/create-waste-movement/successfully/` - Create operation tests
- `scenarios/update-waste-movement/successfully/` - Update operation tests
- Each operation has: `load-test.jmx`, `spike-test.jmx`, `stress-test.jmx`

## When Making Changes
1. Always consider the performance testing focus
2. Maintain the organized folder structure
3. Use shared payload files instead of embedded JSON
4. Follow naming conventions and documentation standards
5. Test changes locally before suggesting them

## Common Tasks
- Adding new performance tests
- Modifying existing test configurations
- Updating payload files for API changes
- Organizing tests by intensity level
- Updating documentation

## What NOT to Do
- Don't add functional testing (handled by regression pack)
- Don't embed JSON directly in JMX files
- Don't create redundant tests
- Don't break the organized folder structure
- Don't ignore documentation updates

## Best Practices
- Always read existing documentation first
- Understand the test organization before making changes
- Use consistent naming and structure
- Focus on performance testing objectives
- Maintain compatibility with CDP Platform
