# Test Intensity Guidelines

## Load Tests (Normal Expected Load)
- **User Count**: 10-50 users
- **Duration**: Medium to Long (15-30 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Test performance under normal expected load
- **When to use**: Regular performance testing, CI/CD pipelines, capacity planning
- **Ramp-up**: Gradual increase over 2-5 minutes
- **Think Time**: 1-3 seconds between requests

## Stress Tests (Beyond Normal Capacity)
- **User Count**: 25-50+ users
- **Duration**: Long (30+ minutes)
- **Purpose**: Find breaking points, test resilience
- **When to use**: Capacity planning, finding service limits
- **Ramp-up**: Gradual increase over 5-10 minutes
- **Think Time**: 0.5-2 seconds between requests

## Spike Tests (Sudden Load Bursts)
- **User Count**: Variable (5→50→5 users)
- **Duration**: Medium (10-20 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Test handling of sudden load spikes
- **When to use**: Traffic burst testing, recovery testing
- **Ramp-up**: Quick spike up, sustain, quick spike down
- **Think Time**: 0.5-1 second between requests

## Test Selection Guidelines
- Start with load tests to establish baseline
- Use stress tests to find breaking points
- Use spike tests to verify recovery capabilities
- Adjust user counts based on service capacity
- Monitor resource utilization during tests
