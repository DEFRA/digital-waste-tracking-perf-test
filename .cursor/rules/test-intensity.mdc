# Test Intensity Guidelines

## Load Tests (Normal Expected Load)

### Create Operations (Single Step)
- **User Count**: 30 users
- **Duration**: 30 minutes (1800s)
- **Ramp-up**: 3 minutes (180s)
- **Think Time**: 500±1000ms (500-1500ms total)
- **Purpose**: Test performance under normal expected load for simple operations

### Update Operations (Two-Step Workflow)
- **User Count**: 30 users
- **Duration**: 30 minutes (1800s)
- **Ramp-up**: 3 minutes (180s)
- **Think Time**: 500±1000ms (500-1500ms total)
- **Purpose**: Test performance under normal expected load for complex workflows

## Stress Tests (Beyond Normal Capacity)

### Create Operations (Single Step)
- **User Count**: 50 users
- **Duration**: 30 minutes (1800s)
- **Ramp-up**: 5 minutes (300s)
- **Think Time**: 500±1000ms (500-1500ms total)
- **Purpose**: Find breaking points for simple operations

### Update Operations (Two-Step Workflow)
- **User Count**: 50 users
- **Duration**: 30 minutes (1800s)
- **Ramp-up**: 5 minutes (300s)
- **Think Time**: 500±1000ms (500-1500ms total)
- **Purpose**: Find breaking points for complex workflows

## Spike Tests (Sudden Load Bursts)

### Both Create and Update Operations
- **Phase 1**: 5 users, 30s ramp-up, 5min duration (baseline)
- **Phase 2**: 50 users, 5s ramp-up, 1min duration (dramatic spike)
- **Phase 3**: 5 users, 10s ramp-up, 5min duration (recovery)
- **Total Duration**: ~11 minutes (5min + 1min + 5min)
- **Think Time**: 500±1000ms (500-1500ms total)

## Test Selection Guidelines
- Start with load tests to establish baseline
- Use stress tests to find breaking points
- Use spike tests to verify recovery capabilities
- Adjust user counts based on service capacity
- Monitor resource utilization during tests
