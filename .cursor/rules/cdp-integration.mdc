# CDP Platform Integration Rules

## CDP-Specific Considerations
- This repository is designed for CDP Platform execution
- Tests run as Docker containers in ECS tasks
- Results are published to CDP Portal
- Platform handles infrastructure provisioning automatically

## Environment Configuration
- Use `${__P(env)}` for environment-specific URLs
- Support multiple environments: dev, test, perf-test, prod
- Configure base URLs for different environments
- Use CDP-specific environment variables

## Docker Integration
- Tests run in Docker containers
- Include proper Dockerfile and entrypoint.sh
- Ensure payload files are accessible in container
- Configure proper working directory in container

## Result Reporting
- Results are automatically published to CDP Portal
- Use CDP-compatible result formats
- Include proper test metadata and labels
- Ensure results are accessible for analysis

## Local Testing
- Support LocalStack for local development
- Include local testing instructions
- Provide Docker commands for local execution
- Support both local and CDP execution modes

## Platform Limitations
- Don't test CDP platform performance (handled by platform)
- Focus on service performance, not infrastructure
- Use CDP-provided monitoring and logging
- Follow CDP best practices for test execution
